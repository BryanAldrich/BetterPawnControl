# Better Pawn Control 

A mod for [Rimworld](https://rimworldgame.com/) available on steam [here](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=775061248)

Allows to assign animals to zones and colonist outfits/drugs in bulk, in a single action.
Allows to set a default outfit when a colonist joins.

## How to use
- Create a policy either for animals or for colonists
- Select the new created policy
- Configure the policy by setting the areas or outfits, etc as you always do
- Done
Repeat this process for other policies as change between them in one click.

## Notes

This mod was first released on Rimword Alpha 15 and is essencially a productive mod to minimise animal areas and colonist outfits and drugs micro-management.
