	<description>Bulk assignment of colonists and animals to outfits, areas, drugs, food, work in one single action. Setup different policies and switch at will. 
	
Annoyed by manually having to set animals to safe areas when raided? This mod can help you! 

You wish to have different outfits policies by season or by events like raid or psychic wave? This mod can help you! 

Enjoy :-)
